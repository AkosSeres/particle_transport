# [Monte Carlo photon transport simulation](https://akosseres.github.io/particle_transport/)

Simulates the transport of monoenergetic gamma photons emitted from a point-like emitter through a scintillation detector and outputs the spectrum made by the photons. The detector is a cylinder shaped Sodium Iodide (NaI) detector centered in the origin.
